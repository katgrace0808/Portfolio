# Portfolio

This is the creation of a portfolio to introduce myself, provide links to completed projects, and to provide a way to contact me.  

There are three page: About (Home page), Contact, and Portfolio.

About (Home page) displays a little bio of who I am, where I am currently working, and a few personal items.  
Contact provides a way to send me a free text message.
Portfolio is a page of widgets that link to the projects I've completed.  A user can click on an image and be directed to the site with
the indicated project.

Each page contains a navbar that links to the other pages for easy navigation.  Also, a footer is present on each page, where a user
can send me an email or link to my LinkedIn account.
